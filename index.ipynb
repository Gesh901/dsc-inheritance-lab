    "# Inheritance - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll use what you've learned about inheritance to model a zoo using superclasses, subclasses, and maybe even an abstract superclass!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a domain model using OOP \n",
    "- Use inheritance to write nonredundant code \n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling a Zoo\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario:  You've been hired by a zookeeper to build a program that keeps track of all the animals in the zoo.  This is a great opportunity to make use of inheritance and object-oriented programming!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an Abstract Superclass\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating an abstract superclass, `Animal()`.  When your program is complete, all subclasses of `Animal()` will have the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `name`, which is a string set at instantation time\n",
    "* `size`, which can be `'small'`, `'medium'`, `'large'`, or `'enormous'` \n",
    "* `weight`, which is an integer set at instantiation time \n",
    "* `species`, a string that tells us the species of the animal\n",
    "* `food_type`, which can be `'herbivore'`, `'carnivore'`, or `'omnivore'`\n",
    "* `nocturnal`, a boolean value that is `True` if the animal sleeps during the day, otherwise `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "They'll also have the following behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sleep`, which prints a string saying if the animal sleeps during day or night\n",
    "* `eat`, which takes in the string `'plants'` or `'meat'`, and returns `'{animal name} the {animal species} thinks {food} is yummy!'` or `'I don't eat this!'` based on the animal's `food_type` attribute \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, create an abstract superclass that meets these specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** For some attributes in an abstract superclass such as `size`, the initial value doesn't matter -- just make sure that you remember to override it in each of the subclasses!"
